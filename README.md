# Confused Python

After completing a couple of Python3 courses on Codecademy, which gave me a general overview and taught me syntax, I'll now be working through the following book and trying to complete the challenges within it, as well as creating my own small challenges and projects as I go.

Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul

This book uses C++ throughout, but I'm going to be trying to do the exercises in Python. Even know though I don't know Python! Hopefully it'll help me to learn by doing, as well as teach me how to approach coding in a problem solving manner instead of focusing purely on syntax.

# confused-python

After completing a couple of Python3 courses on Codecademy, which gave me a general overview and taught me syntax, I'll now be working through two books, and trying to complete the challenges within them.

Book #1: Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul (TLAP)
Book #2: A Common Sense Guide To Data Structres and Algorithms (CSGTDSA)

TLAP: This book uses C++ throughout, but I'm going to be trying to do my own version of his code in Python. Even know though I don't know Python! Hopefully it'll help me to learn by doing, as well as teach me how to approach coding in a problem solving manner instead of focusing purely on syntax.

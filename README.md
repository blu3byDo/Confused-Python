# Think-Like-A-Programmer

After completing a couple of Python3 courses on Codecademy, which gave me a general overview and taught me syntax, I'll now be working through the following book and trying to complete the challenges within it.

Think Like A Programmer by V. Anton Spraul

This book uses C++ throughout, but I'm going to be trying to ddo the exercises in Python. Even know though I don't know Python! Hopefully it'll help me to learn by doing, as well as teach me how to approach coding in a problem solving manner instead of focusing purely on syntax.

Due to the author only using C++ throughout the book, t means I won't be able to refer to his examples that the exercises are based around, so I really will be going it alone.

Any one who reads my code is likely to be horrified at how it looks. If you stumble across my code and can recommend changes then please do. I'm always keen to hear how things can be done better.
